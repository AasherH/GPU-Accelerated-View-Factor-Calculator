It is easiest to run this code in the following manner:

Edit the TEDServer.java class and edit the "emitterFileName," "receiverFileName," and "blockFileName" variables to match the locations of the STL files on the user's local machine.

If you want to run the jar file, ensure that the MT_ViewFactor_Calculator folder is on the Desktop (assuming that the user is operating on the local machine's C Drive). Then, open the MT_ViewFactor_Calculator.jar file via double-clicking to run. The jar file can be found in (\out\artifacts)

If you want more flexibility and see the code execute (recommended), download IntelliJ (editor) and run the code. Note that this method requires the libraries within the repository to be used in IntelliJ
